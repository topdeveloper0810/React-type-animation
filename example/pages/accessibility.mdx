# Accessibility

Because the typing animation _A)_ delays and _B)_ constantly manipulates the written text, it is not only bothersome but sometimes even **impossible for screen readers** to capture the entire text at once.

If your type animation component includes **actual text ("content")** or conveys an important message that is not purely decorative, you should make your typewriter animation accessible to screen readers.

## Visually-hidden Class

The perhaps best approach to make a typewriter animation accessible is **1.)** additionally rendering the conveyed message of the `<TypeAnimation />` in a separate wrapper with a _visually-hidden_ class that only hides the content for sighted users and **2.)** setting `aria-hidden="true"` on the `<TypeAnimation />` to remove it from the a11y tree:

```tsx {2-16,18}
<span style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
  <span
    style={{
      clip: 'rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px)',
      clipPath: 'inset(50%)',
      height: '1px',
      width: '1px',
      margin: '-1px',
      overflow: 'hidden',
      padding: '0',
      position: 'absolute',
    }}
  >
    {/* The most important content of the typewriter animation: Hidden from sighted viewers but (in most cases) accessible to screen readers */}
    We produce food for Mice, Hamsters, Guinea Pigs and Chinchillas
  </span>
  <TypeAnimation
    aria-hidden="true"
    sequence={[
      'We produce food for Mice',
      1000,
      'We produce food for Hamsters',
      1000,
      'We produce food for Guinea Pigs',
      1000,
      'We produce food for Chinchillas',
      1000,
    ]}
    wrapper="span"
  />
</span>
```

## Alternative: aria-label

One can also add an `aria-label` directly on the `<TypeAnimation />` component to convey the most important contents of the typewriter animation:

```tsx {2}
<TypeAnimation
  aria-label="We produce food for Mice, Hamsters, Guinea Pigs and Chinchillas"
  role="marquee"
  sequence={[
    // Same String at the start will only be typed once, initially
    'We produce food for Mice',
    1000,
    'We produce food for Hamsters',
    1000,
    'We produce food for Guinea Pigs',
    1000,
    'We produce food for Chinchillas',
    1000,
  ]}
  wrapper="div"
  repeat={Infinity}
/>
```

Setting an `aria-label` requires setting a `role` as well. The role [`marquee`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/marquee_role) is probably the most suitable for this situation.

By applying an `aria-label`, the dynamically typed contents of your sequence will automatically be wrapped in a `<span/>` with `aria-hidden="true"` and removed from the accessibility tree:

```tsx {aria-hidden="true"}
{/* Rendered HTML: */}
<div
  aria-label="We produce food for Mice, Hamsters, Guinea Pigs and Chinchillas"
>
  <span aria-hidden="true">We pro [...]</span>
</div>
```

  Note: `aria-label` should generally only be used on interactive elements,
  which may make this approach not ideal. Certain screen readers may even
  disregard this aria-label entirely as it is applied to a non-interactive
  wrapper element.
